Environment Overview — Spark on OpenShift (DEV-RNS)
🧱 Cluster & Platform

You’re running on OpenShift 4.x (Red Hat) with Istio (Maistra 2.6.6).

You access via a bastion host and use oc + helm for administration.

Your cluster runs multiple application projects (namespaces), including:

dev-rns → main app namespace (where Spark jobs run)

dev-spark-operator → Spark Operator controller namespace

dev-spark → legacy / supporting chart or service deployment

dev-admin → admin-level services like admin-adminservice

⚙️ Spark Deployment Architecture
Component	Namespace	Description	Status
Spark Operator (Helm-based)	dev-spark-operator	Helm release spark-operator, image registry.dev.sbiepay.sbi:8443/apache/spark-kubernetes-operator:0.4.0	✅ Running
Watched Namespace(s)	dev-rns	Operator only reconciles jobs in dev-rns	✅ Confirmed via logs
Spark History Server	dev-spark-operator	ClusterIP service spark-history-server:18080	✅ Active
Spark CRDs	Cluster-wide	sparkapplications.spark.apache.org & sparkclusters.spark.apache.org	✅ Installed
Driver/Executor Jobs	dev-rns	Created dynamically by Operator on SparkApplication submission	✅ Working
Job Lifecycle	Ephemeral	Driver pods created → run → terminated after job completion	✅ Expected behavior
🔒 Security, RBAC & SCC
Resource	Namespace	Purpose	Status
spark-operator	dev-spark-operator	Operator SA	✅
spark-sa	dev-rns	Used by driver/executor pods	✅
spark-scc-binding	ClusterRoleBinding	Binds SCC → SA	✅
spark-scc	SCC	Custom security policy for Spark pods	✅
spark-operator-clusterrolebinding	ClusterRoleBinding	Grants operator CRD control	✅
SCC Privileges		Driver pods have necessary volumes + runAsAny	✅
🧩 Applications Using Spark

You have two major app deployments (Helm-managed):

App	Namespace	Role	Interaction with Spark
ops-operationsservice	dev-rns	Main backend service	Submits Spark jobs (Recon etc.)
refund-refundservice	dev-rns	Companion service	Likely interacts with output / job triggers
Recon Spark Jobs	dev-rns	via recon-spark-app.yaml	Processed by Operator, driver/executor pods auto-created

These services interact with Spark via REST or internal Java clients, not manual spark-submit.

🧠 Behavioral Notes

When a developer or backend service (like ops-operationsservice) submits a Spark job, the SparkApplication CRD is created.

The Spark Operator in dev-spark-operator reconciles it → launches driver/executor pods → updates CRD status.

Once the job finishes → the driver & executors are terminated automatically.

Logs are pushed to the Spark History Server.

Prometheus-compatible metrics are exposed from the operator (/metrics endpoint on port 19091).

📊 Current Observations

✅ Operator stable for 70+ days
✅ Health and readiness probes OK
✅ Metrics service up
✅ CRDs healthy
⚠️ Kerberos warning — irrelevant since you’re using S3, Oracle JDBC
✅ RBAC bindings valid
✅ Spark jobs complete and clean up correctly
✅ Istio sidecar injection active (2.6.6)
✅ Helm charts managing everything cleanly

🧩 Your Setup Type (Summary)

You’re running Spark-on-Kubernetes Operator pattern, not standalone Spark.

✔ No manual spark-submit

✔ Jobs launched via CRD (SparkApplication)

✔ Operator handles driver lifecycle

✔ History server manages logs

✔ SCC & RBAC customized for OpenShift security

✔ Istio-compatible (mesh injected pods)

✔ All managed via Helm

🧰 What We Can Do Next

If you confirm, I can now:

🧾 Generate a diagnostic collector (single shell script) — will gather:

SparkApplications (status, duration, exit reasons)

Operator logs (last 500 lines)

SCC + RoleBindings summary

Active driver/executor pod details

History Server service check
→ Output as /tmp/spark_dev_rns_diagnostic.txt

📊 Build a visual topology diagram showing:

Operator → CRD → Driver Pod → Executor Pods

Namespaces and network flow (with Istio mesh)

⚡ Draft a production-readiness checklist for Spark Operator on OpenShift (security, scaling, monitoring).
